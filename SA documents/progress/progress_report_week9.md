## 第九周进度报告

### 徐楚玉

Recently,the main assignment of me is studying the evolution perspective of Sealtalk. Since there is little information about this app on the Internet, I write the evolution perspective mainly depends on the data in its official website. Fortunately,I find the changelog of Sealtalk on website easily. There are about 70-80 changelogs, which record the evolution of Sealtalk since it was released in 2016.I look through all of them for several times and write down some updates that I think is worthy to be noticed in the report. In order to make it more clear, I also drew a picture describing the evolution process.
